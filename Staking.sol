/**
 * Allows token owners to lock tokens for the period of time.
 *
 * A non-custodial way to lock up tokens.
 * For lock ups, the emitted events are read on the server-side
 * and can trigger actions like subscription.
 *
 * For each stake action, we give an unique id and generate an event.
 * Then the user can get these events from logs and unstake by id.
 *
 * Staking happens by sending the correct amonut of tokens
 * to the contract using ERC-777 send().
 *
 * We are not using SafeMath here, as we are not doing accounting math.
 * user gets out the same amount of tokens they send in.
